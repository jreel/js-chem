  <p>Testing my chemform function. (View the page source to compare input/output!)</p>

<p>Here is some text where I am talking about compounds such as CO2, H2O, H2SO4.</p>

<p>Ba(NO3)2 (aq) + Na2SO4 (aq) ------> 2NaNO3 (aq) + BaSO4 (s)</p>

  <p>HCl (g) + H2O(l) <===> H3O(+) (aq) + Cl(-) (aq)</p>

<p>In this paragraph I mention polyatomic ions, such as [NH4]+, [NO3]-, CO3(2-). Also, we could think about
   the first two written together like so:</p>
<p>[NH4]+ [NO3]- or NH4(+) NO3(-).</p>

<p>What about elements such as Au(0)?</p>
<p>Let's try to break it: what if I put in some numbers in the text, like mentioning 10 moles of whatever?</p>

<p>Or 2.5 moles?</p>

<p>What about hyphens with numbers? This section will also test deep nesting and formatting.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The reactions were all conducted at 80-100&deg; for 1-2 hours.</li>
  <li>The name of this compound is <strong><em>2-methylcyclohexanone</em></strong>.</li>
  <li>A different compound would be <em>(2R,3S)</em>-1,2,3-butanetriol. Can you draw it?</li>
</ul>
